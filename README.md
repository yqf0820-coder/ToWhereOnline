# ToWhere Online V1.0

> A private universe for travel memories, first moments, letters, and daily energy.

![ToWhere Online V1.0](./docs/images/online-cover.jpg)

ToWhere Online is an interactive memory archive built with React. It turns places, photos, words, and small daily records into a visual space that can be opened, explored, and revisited.

It started as a personal gift, so the product shape is intentionally intimate: a starry entry, a living globe, city memories, FIRSTS timeline, letters, music, and an Energy Station for recording emotional gravity over time.

## What It Does

### ToWhere Globe

The main travel view places memories on a globe. Cities become points in space, and each place can lead into a dedicated detail page with photos and story fragments.

### FIRSTS Timeline

FIRSTS records important first moments: the first trip, the first small ritual, the first sentence worth saving. Records can include dates, text, categories, and images.

### Memory Universe

The keyword and particle experience turns relationship keywords into an interactive star field. It is less like a dashboard and more like a constellation of shared context.

### Letters

Letters are kept as a quieter written archive. They sit beside the visual travel records and make the project feel less like a gallery and more like a time capsule.

### Energy Station

Energy Station records daily status for different users and visualizes the trend with charts and a calendar history.

### City Admin Tools

The admin panel supports city data and image management through Supabase and GitHub-based storage utilities.

## Tech Stack

- React 18
- Vite 5
- Three.js
- React Three Fiber
- Cesium / Resium
- Supabase
- Framer Motion
- Recharts

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

VITE_GITHUB_OWNER=your_github_username_or_org
VITE_GITHUB_REPO=your_repo_name
VITE_GITHUB_BRANCH=main
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Supabase Setup

Run the SQL in [`supabase-schema.sql`](./supabase-schema.sql) inside the Supabase SQL Editor.

If you use image uploads for FIRSTS, create a Supabase Storage bucket named:

```txt
firsts-images
```

## Data Sources

ToWhere Online uses a few storage layers:

- Supabase Database for city data, FIRSTS records, letters, and dynamic configuration
- Supabase Storage for uploaded FIRSTS images
- GitHub Contents API for repository-based city image management
- LocalStorage for client-side admin token state and local fallbacks

Some private photos, music, videos, and records may be intentionally excluded or replaced before publishing.

## Notes

This is a personal creative project rather than a generic SaaS template.

- Desktop is the primary experience.
- Mobile currently presents a partial version of the full interaction.
- Data models are optimized for a private memory archive.
- Public reuse should replace the personal media and records with your own content.

This project is shared as a personal creative work. Please do not reuse private images, text, music, videos, or personal data without permission.
